The Abbey Theatre,https://www.abbeytheatre.org.uk/,St Albans,Hertfordshire,,Provided - Not on Website,Information Available - Win,,"The width of seats in each area.  In the main auditorium, seats are 16-17 inches wide, with Rows A & B slightly nearer 16"" and remaining rows 17"". All our seats in the main theatre have fixed arm rests on both sides.
 Seats at either end of every row have seats on one side only, but still have fixed arm rests on the aisle side.
 As our seats are in fixed rows on joined metal frames, there is not much flexibility. Customers with access requests should contact me direct to discuss options.  We remove two seats at the far end of the front row to accommodate a wheelchair, and it might be possible to look at having a free-standing chair in this space on request, but this has H&S implications in the event of an emergency."
